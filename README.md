rtmchecklist
============
create a list using a tag: <rtmchecklist>, each line before the ending tag </rtmchecklist> will be a task.

Sample:
 <rtmchecklist>
 aaaa
 bbbb
 </rtmchecklist>

You can also use the short version:

 <rtmchecklist>aaaa|bbbb</rtmchecklist>

The list of task is then sent to the email address you can set in your profile at "RTM import e-mail".
