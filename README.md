This is a plugin for dokuwiki (https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins).

Current version is beta: use at your own risk !

Create a list using a tag: <rtmchecklist>, each line before the ending tag </rtmchecklist> will be a task.

Sample:

You can also use the short version:

 &lt;rtmchecklist&rt;aaaa|bbbb&lt;/rtmchecklist&rt;

The list of task is then sent to the email address you can set in your profile at "RTM import e-mail".
